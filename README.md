**Healthcare shouldn't be fragmented. It should be seamless.**

We are building the digital backbone for India's healthcare ecosystem. One platform to connect 1.4 billion lives, thousands of hospitals, and millions of healthcare professionals.

## The Problem

Healthcare in India is disconnected. 
- **Patients** carry physical files from doctor to doctor.
- **Hospitals** struggle with siloed data.
- **Clinics** lack affordable, modern tools.
- **Labs** operate in isolation.

This fragmentation costs money, time, and sometimes, lives.

## Our Vision

We believe in a future where your health history travels with you, securely and instantly. 

**Nayeli Medtech** leverages the power of **Aadhaar** to create a unified, interoperable healthcare network. We are not just building software; we are building infrastructure for a healthier India.

## What We Do

We provide a unified platform that serves everyone in the ecosystem:

### For Hospitals & Clinics
Enterprise-grade management tools that just work. Streamline operations, reduce paperwork, and focus on what matters: patient care.

### For Laboratories
Connected diagnostic networks. Results that reach doctors and patients instantly, without the friction.

### For Patients
Your health, in your hands. Access your records, book appointments, and manage your family's health from a single, secure app.

## Why Now?

India is ready. With the digital public infrastructure revolution (UPI, Aadhaar), the timing is perfect for a Unified Health Interface. We are here to build it.

## Join the Revolution

We are currently in the validation phase, gathering feedback from forward-thinking healthcare providers and partners.

If you believe that healthcare deserves a modern operating system, we want to hear from you.
